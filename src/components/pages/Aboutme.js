            <p>
              I am Robinson, and I am 35 years old.
              I am currently a Web Development student with ambitious goals of starting a new career in IT.
              Previously, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and worked in the IT field as an IT Support Analyst for 3 years. However, I decided to interrupt my career to face the challenge of moving to Australia to improve my English skills.
              Since arriving in Australia, in addition to studying English, I have dedicated time to studying various subjects to enhance my soft skills, including leadership management and project management.
              Currently, I work as a team leader, operating and developing codes for CNC machines.
              I consider myself an unstoppable person, and my ultimate goal is to return to my initial plan of pursuing a career in IT. I believe it is the right time to invest in myself and develop the necessary skills to re-enter the IT field. After conducting extensive research, I realized that Web Development aligns with my aspirations as it combines coding with dynamic activities that truly captivate me.
